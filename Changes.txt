Haversine Function Implementation:
Added haversine function to calculate great-circle distance between two GPS coordinates
Function takes four parameters: lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 (in degrees)
Returns distance in meters

Sliding Window Approach for GPS Coordinates:
Implemented WINDOW_SIZE constant (set to 5) for storing recent GPS readings
Added lat_window and lon_window arrays to store latitude and longitude history
Introduced window_index variable to manage circular buffer behavior
Added window_filled flag to indicate when the window has been fully populated

Motion Detection Improvements:
Modified get_location function to use sliding window approach
Calculated average movement using differences between consecutive coordinates in the window
Implemented MOTION_THRESHOLD constant for detecting significant movement
Added logic to compare average movement against MOTION_THRESHOLD
Integrated PIR sensor reading with GPS-based motion detection

Debugging Enhancements:
Added debug messages to display average movement calculations
Implemented more detailed motion detection status messages
